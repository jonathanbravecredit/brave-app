        Brave Credit provides a platform that offers insights about, and services to help you understand and manage,
        your financial information. Brave Credit is not a credit repair organization or credit counselor, nor does it

        We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We
        reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at
        https://brave.credit, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means. If you don’t agree with the new
        Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If
        you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the

          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Payment Method. </span>The terms of your payment will be based on
          your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card
          issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive
          payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.

          OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT
          METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS
          THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT
          ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE

          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Change in Amount Authorized. </span>If the amount to be charged to
          your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in
          the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to
          be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have
          with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate
          charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.

        <li>
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reaffirmation of Authorization. </span>Your non-termination or
          continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid
          Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not
          waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per
          usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.

        <i>(a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. </i>The parties shall use their best efforts
        to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of
        these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating
        arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration
        in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with
        the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator
        with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator
        shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the
        award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

        its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

        Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to
        pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent

        disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less
