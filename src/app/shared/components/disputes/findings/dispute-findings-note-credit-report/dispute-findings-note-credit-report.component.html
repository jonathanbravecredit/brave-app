  <p class="text-lg font-semibold">A Note on Credit Report Updates</p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-4">Information in your credit report is updated frequently which means items you disputed may not appear on your credit report or have already changed by the time we received your dispute. In most cases, the Date Updated or Reported date represents the last time the account information was updated or reported by the data furnisher. Please note that this date may not change following our investigation of your dispute. For Last Payment, please keep in mind, the data may not represent very recent payment activity. For inactive accounts or accounts that have been closed and paid, Pay Status (sometimes just “Status”) represents the last known status of the account.</p>
